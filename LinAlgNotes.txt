Improvements for Guassian Elimation Code:

1) How to pass 2D array into function w/ general size?
   e.g., pass into showMatrix(), pivotElim(), and backSub().

2) Dynamically allocate arrays s.t. user can choose system size at
   runtime & array size can be larger.
  -> this causes arrays not to be able to passed into functions b/c
     2nd size is required
