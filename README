This program is my first significant C++ code. The driver file LinAlgDriver.cpp
calls routines defined in the secondary files:

ConjugateGrad.cpp     GuassianElim.cpp     GMRES.cpp
Inout.cpp             LinAlgToolkit.cpp    LSQ.cpp

in order to solve a linear system Ax=b using a method chosen by the user at
runtime. This module includes methods to solve both square and overdetermined
systems. Toy systems with which to test the methods on can be found in the
Toy_Systems folder within this module1 directory.

The matrix A and vector b that define the system are to be read in from two
separate files (e.g., mat_A.dat and vec_b.dat). The names of these two files may
be provided by the user as command line arguments, but if omitted, the program
will then prompt the user to enter the filenames.

After reading in the contents from the two files, the program prompts the user
to choose a numerical method to apply. Once a selection is made, the program
executes the method, displays the results, and writes the solution vector to a
file named x_soln.dat.

The Matrix.h and Vector.h files contain the declarations of the Matrix and
Vector user-defined classes respectively, while the corresponding .cpp files
contain their member function implementations.
