This program is my first significant C++ code. The driver file LinAlgDriver.cpp
calls routines defined in the secondary files:

ConjugateGrad.cpp
GuassianElim.cpp
GMRES.cpp
Inout.cpp
LinAlgToolkit.cpp

in order to solve a square linear system Ax=b using a method chosen by the
user at runtime.

The matrix A and vector b that define the system are to be read in from two
separate files (e.g., mat_A.dat and vec_b.dat). The names of these two files may
be provided by the user as command line arguments, but if omitted, the program
will then prompt the user to enter the filenames.

After reading in the contents from the two files, the program prompts the user
to choose a numerical method to apply. Once a selection is made, the program
executes the method, displays the results, and writes the solution vector to a
file named x_soln.dat.
